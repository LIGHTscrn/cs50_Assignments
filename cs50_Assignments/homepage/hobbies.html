                While I was born on 2005 january 6th i was raised mostly in Kerala an South Indian State popular for its culture ,also sometimes called as "Gods Own Country".
                I had a not very typical childhood ,mostly because of communication and looks.I used to look different from others and had difficulty in communicating properly.The main language used in Kerala was Malayalam.I knew nothing about the language ,at home my mom spoke Marathi, my father spoke hindi and the only time i used malayalam was when i am communicating with others. The language-teachers hated me so did i hate them. Slowly i realized and wanted malayalam out of my life so i kept fighting it untill 10th standard because afterwards i could choose a different language and completely be free from the constraint of passing the language exams,I excelled in English and Hindi as i moved forward.
                I am also not good at making freinds.I was given a perfect healthy body to live my life and i appreciate the good genes , but i lack social skills. I wonder if i continued living in North India would i have a different lifestyle and a proper communication skill?
                Maybe i would have been a perfect human being if so.But Ultimately i am happy with what i have now.

                <ul>
                    <li><text class="text-warning" >Athletism</text> . Not sure if thats a word but I like to maintain my physique ,i work out daily in the after noon before studying and it helps me mentally relax and strengthen my self-esteem.</li>
                    <li><text class="text-warning">Running</text> . Runnning barefoor might be harmfull for my knees so i try to wear shoes, I like to run a lot , i run 4 km everyday in the morning when i can without stopping. It gives me the confidence i need for the day , and the fact that it tires my legs so much that i could barely walk XD</li>
                    <li><text class="text-warning">Doing uncomfortable things</text> . Sometimes at certain situations i find things that i dont want to do ,So i force myself to do it even if i dont want to do it.Its mentally challenging but i like it and hate it at the same time </li>
